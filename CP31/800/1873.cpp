A 10×10
 target is made out of five "rings" as shown. Each ring has a different point value: the outermost ring — 1 point, the next ring — 2 points, ..., the center ring — 5 points.


Vlad fired several arrows at the target. Help him determine how many points he got.

Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of 10 lines, each containing 10 characters. Each character in the grid is either X
 (representing an arrow) or .
 (representing no arrow).

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the total number of points of the arrows.

Note
In the first test case, there are three arrows on the outer ring worth 1 point each, two arrows on the ring worth 3 points each, and two arrows on the ring worth 4 points each. The total score is 3×1+2×3+2×4=17
.

In the second test case, there aren't any arrows, so the score is 0
